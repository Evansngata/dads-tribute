            <h2>About Him</h2>
            <p>
                My dad, <strong>Jeremiah Njenga</strong>, was a man of love, wisdom, and strength.
                Born and raised in Kiambu, Kenya, he was a family man and my inspiration.
                He was calm in how he acted and every moment being around him was great.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it was watching games with him, or going on errands with him, he somehow 
                knew how to make me smile.
                His laughter, personality and structure shaped me into who I am now.
